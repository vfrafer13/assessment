# Beginner WordPress Assessment

This is our standard assessment for incoming WordPress developers aimed toward basic experience with WordPress.

Please follow the steps below and turn it in to us when you are done!

> NOTE: Anything marked as 'BONUS' is **NOT** required and is only there if you feel like showing off. That being said,
> feel free to show off. Have fun with it!

## Setup

> WARNING: This setup assumes a Linux-based system (Linux, macOS, Windows >= 10 w/ WSL) running node version ~18 with
> npm version ~8 and Docker. If you have trouble running anything, it probably has something to do with the above.

1. Fork this repo, clone it to your local and cd into the directory.
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run env:init`
1. Run `npm run env:launch`

**Away We Go!**

In a few minutes, you should have a fresh WordPress install up and running with a simple theme named WordPress
Assessment activated. The service assumes it can run on port 8888, so if there's a conflict there, you'll have to
edit `.wp-env.json`, run `npm run env:destroy` and then re-run `npm run env:init`.

Any changes made to the `./content/` folder will show up on the WordPress install.

**WP-CLI**

If you need to run any wp-cli commands, it is available via either `npx wp-env run cli [command]` OR, you can use
the `./bin/wp.sh` which should make things a bit easier.

## Steps

- [ x] Clone or fork this repo, then establish a public repository where your code will live and can be viewed by us.
- [ x] Create 5 sample posts and 5 pages inside WordPress.
    - [ x] Bonus points: Use wp-cli, or some automated way to do this.
- [ x] Create a custom "Movie" post type and create 10 sample Movie posts.
    - [ x] Create a custom "Genre" taxonomy and attach it to the `movie` post type only.
- [ x] Update the `assessment` theme so it features the following:
    - [ x] Homepage - 5 Movie Posts
        - [ x]Each post should have a featured image, an excerpt and a link to the movie single post page.
        - [ ]Bonus points: infinite scroll or pagination.
    - [ x] Single Movie Post (Featured image, title, genre, full text)
        - [ x]Bonus points: Showcase links to other movies.
    - [ x] Single Post (Featured image, author, title, text)
    - [ x] Single Page (Can be just title, author and text)
- [ x] Add instructions on requirements, installation and running everything to your README file.

## Testing steps
- After setting up the project per the instructions in the `Setup` section above.
- Run `./setup.sh` to fill your database with starting authors, images, posts, pages, and genres.
    - If the script returns an error, try to update your permissions first with `chmod +x setup.sh`.
- Navigate to http://localhost:8888/ and that's it! Have a look at the different posts and pages on the site.

## Requirements

- Ideally you'd use the @wordpress/env (Docker-based) setup so that we can all run this on our machines.
- Any JavaScript libraries should be installed via package.json.
- Add installation and instructions for running your code in your README.
- I need to be able to independently run whatever you produce locally, so I can see the same result you want me to see.

## Preferences

- Please don't include your whole database image (if you need to, you can include a database dump, like `dump.sql`).
- The more automated the better (think fewer steps for the assessor to complete to get things working).

## Common Issues

* **I have an error about port 8888 being in use.**

  You likely already have something running on port 8888. Stop any web services you may already have running, and try
  again. If that doesn't work, and you're on Mac or Linux, try this:
  ```shell
  lsof -i :8888
  ```
  This should give you an idea of what service you need to stop/kill to be able to run this project.

  If that doesn't work, edit the ports in `.wp-env.json` and start the instructions over.
  
  
* **I'm getting an error running npm install.**

  Make sure you're using the right version of `node/npm` as specified above by checking:
  
  ```shell
  node --version
  npm --version
  ```
